    </p>
    <p>
      And this I

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; time
    </p>
    <p>
      And some
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this I will
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; again,

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; repeated,

    <p>
      And all will be

      dream
    </p>
    <p>
      You will
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
      everything I have seen in

      &nbsp; &nbsp; ourselves,

      To one side from

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; shore,
    </p>
    <p>
      Wave follows
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; to break on the

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
      a star,
    </p>
    <p>
      On each wave is
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      a person,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      a bird,
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Dreams, reality, death - on wave after wave.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      No need for a date: I was, I am, and I will be,
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is a wonder of wonders, and to wonder
    </p>
    <p>
      I dedicate myself, on my knees, like an orphan,
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone - among mirrors - fenced in by reflections:
    </p>
    <p>
      Cities and seas, iridescent, intensified.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mother in tears takes a child on her lap.
