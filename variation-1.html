    <p>And this I dreamt, and this I dream,</p>
    <p>by Arseny Tarkovsky</p>
    <br />

    <p>And this I dreamt, </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and this I dream,</p>
    <p>And some time this,  </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will dream again,</p>
    <p>And repeated, </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all be re-embodied,</p>
    <p>You will dream everything,</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have seen in dream.</p>

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      To one side from ourselves,
    </p>
    <p>to one side from the world</p>
    <p>

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      Wave follows wave
    </p>
    <p>to break on the shore,</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      a bird,

      death-
    </p>
    <p>on wave after wave.</p>
    <br />

    <p>No need for a date: </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      I was,

      I am and

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      I will be,
    </p>
    <p>Life is</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      a wonder

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      of wonders,

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      and to wonder
