      And this I dreamt, and this I dream,
    </p>
    <p>By Arseny Tarkovsky</p>
    <br />

    <p>
      And this I dreamt, and this I dream,
    </p>
    <p>
      And some time this I will dream again,
    </p>
    <p>
      And all will be repeated, all be re-embodied,
    </p>
    <p>
      You will dream everything I have seen in dream.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      To one side from ourselves, to one side from the world
    </p>
    <p>
      Wave follows wave to break on the shore,
    </p>
    <p>
      On each wave is a star, a person, a bird,
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreams, reality, death - on wave after wave.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      No need for a date: I was, I am, and I will be,
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is a wonder of wonders, and to wonder
    </p>
    <p>
      I dedicate myself, on my knees, like an orphan,
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone - among mirrors - fenced in by reflections:
    </p>
    <p>
      Cities and seas, iridescent, intensified.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mother in tears takes a child on her lap.
