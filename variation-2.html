    <p>And this I dreamt, and this I dream</p>
    <p>by Arseny Tarkovsky</p>
    <br />
    <p>And this I dreamt,</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      and this I dream,
    </p>
    <p>And some time this </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      I will dream again,
    </p>
    <p>And all wil be repeated, </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      all be re-embodied,
    </p>
    <p>You will dream everything</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      I have seen in dream.

    <p>
      To one side from ourselves,
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      to one side from the world,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
      Wave follows wave
    </p>

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp;
      to break on the shore,
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      On each wave is
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      a star,

    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      a person,

      death-

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      on wave

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      after wave.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>
      No need for a date:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      I was,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      I am,
    </p>
    <p>
      and
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      I will be,
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      a wonder
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      of wonders
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      and to wonder
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      I dedicate myself,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      on my knees,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      like an orphan,
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone-
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      among mirrors-
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      fenced in by reflections:
    </p>
    <p>
      Cities and seas,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      iridescent,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      intensified.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mother in tears
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      takes a child on her lap.
